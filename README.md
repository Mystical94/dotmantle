# DotMantle

### 📝 Project Description

#### 😎 Idea
- Web3 Domains: The Future of Decentralized Web Addresses
- Web3 domains are a new type of web address that are designed to be decentralized, secure, and censorship-resistant.
- Unlike traditional web addresses, which are owned and controlled by centralized entities such as domain registrars and web hosting companies, DotMantle domains are owned and controlled by their owners on Mantle Blockchain.
- The current centralized web domain system has several flaws, including high costs, limited privacy, and vulnerability to censorship and hacking.
- Moreover, it is controlled by a small number of large corporations, which can limit competition and innovation in the web industry.

#### 💻 Implementation
- We have deployed the smart contracts on the Mantle Blockchain.
- We have then integarted the smart contacts with our custom build user interface for users to interact with the protocol.

#### 👥 Intended Users
- People who want a secure and tamper-proof record of ownership and control, while also enabling seamless and instant transactions between users.
- Users who want privacy and anonymity as they are not required to disclose their personal information to centralized authorities.

### ✒ Summary
- By enabling users to own and control their online identities and activities, DotMantle promote greater freedom, privacy, and innovation in the web industry.

### ☄️ What's next?
- More doamins will be added and and will also develop that users can mint any domain name of their own choice.
- Domain Name Marketplace will also be developed so that users can resell their domains to other users.
- Creating a fully community-driven protocol in which the community votes on all protocol-related decisions.
